Prerequisites:

1. Java 1.8
2. Eclipse or IntelliJIDEA

Libraries used:

1. RestAssured API

4. Java programming Language

Advantages Using RestAssured API:

1. It removes the need for writing a lot of boilerplate code required to set up an HTTP connection, send a request and receive and parse a response.
2. It supports a Given/When/Then test notation, which instantly makes your tests human readable.
3. Since REST Assured is a Java library, integrating it into a continuous integration / continuous delivery setup is a breeze, especially when combined with a Java testing framework such as TestNG

Dependency Installation:

1. Go to Eclipse Market place and add TestNG to the project

Execution:

1. Go to src/test/java folder
2. Right click on any test
3. Choose "Run As" option
4. select TestNG


UI Automation:

Prerequisites:

1. Node.js
2. npm
3. WebDriverIO 
4. VSCode
5. Latest version of Chrome (Note: chrome binary version in the project should match with local version of chrome)


Libraries Used:

1. Javascript
2. WDIO
3. Mocha
4. Allure reports 

Advantages of WebDriverIO:

1. Able to run automation tests both for web applications as well as native mobile apps
2. Simple and Easy Syntax - Looks like BDD format. Example - Go to any test under specs folder and functions are written in plain English which easy to understand
3. Integrating tests to third-party tools such as Appium
4. 'Wdio setup wizard' to make the setup simple and easy
5. Integrated test runner

Steps to run the project:

1. npm i - to install required dependencies/update the dependencies
2. npm install @wdio/cli
3. npx wdio config
4. To run tests - give the command in command-line : npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js

Steps to retrieve Allure Reports:

1. npm install @wdio/allure-reporter --save-dev
2. npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev - to add allure to the command-line
3. allure generate && allure open OR allure generate and allure open
